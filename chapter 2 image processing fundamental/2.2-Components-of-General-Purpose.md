## 1.Components of General Purpose Digital Image Processing Systems


- Network
- Image displays
- Computer
- Mass storage
- Hardcopy
- Specialized image processing hardware
- Image processing software
- Image sensors




## 2.Key Processes in Digital Image Processing

### Image Acquisition
- Description: The initial step where the image is captured using sensors.
- Visual Element:
  - An image of a camera or image sensor.
  - An example of an image being acquired (e.g., a photo of a scene).



### Image Enhancement
- Description: Techniques applied to improve the visibility of features in an image.
- Visual Element:
  - Before and after images showing enhanced details (e.g., a low-contrast image next to a high-contrast version).
  - Graphical representation of enhancement techniques (e.g., histogram equalization).


### Image Restoration
- Description: Process of recovering an image that has been degraded.
- Visual Element:
  - A side-by-side comparison of a degraded image and its restored version.
  - A flowchart showing the mathematical models used for restoration.



## 3.Additional Processes
###  Color Image Processing
   - Important due to the rise in digital image use.
- Wavelets
   - Foundation for representing images at various resolutions.
- Compression
   - Techniques for reducing storage and transmission bandwidth.
- Segmentatio
   - Partitioning an image into its constituent parts.


## 4.Elements of Digital Image Processing Systems

- Storage (Short term, on-line, archival)
- Processing (Algorithmic procedures in software)
- Display (Enables end-users to see results)
- Communication (Local and remote communication challenges)
